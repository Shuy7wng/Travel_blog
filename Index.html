        <h2>MAIN BODY</h2>
        <p>Lisbon welcomes with its steep hills where yellow trams rattle through Alfama, a neighborhood alive with laundry lines and the aroma of grilled sardines. Belém impresses with monumental treasures like the Tower and the Jerónimos Monastery, symbols of Portugal’s Age of Discoveries. Just a short train ride away, Sintra appears almost magical, with pastel-colored palaces, ornate gardens, and misty forests that seem drawn from a fairytale. Northward, Obidos surprises with cobblestone lanes encircled by medieval walls, while Nazaré thrills visitors with the thunderous waves that attract surfers from all over the globe. Coimbra invites a slower rhythm, where centuries of academic life echo through the arcades of its ancient university. Porto enchants with shimmering blue azulejos, wine lodges along the Douro, and sunsets painting the riverbanks in golden tones. In the Alentejo, Évora’s Roman ruins and Gothic churches stand proudly in the quiet landscape. Finally, the Algarve delights with cliffs sculpted by the ocean, beaches of fine sand, and small fishing villages that retain their charm.</p>

        <h2>USE TIPS FOR TRAVELERS</h2>
        <p>The rail system is efficient for moving between Lisbon, Coimbra, and Porto, but renting a car is the best choice for exploring the Algarve and the Douro Valley. Book Sintra’s palaces early to avoid queues, taste pastel de nata fresh from the oven, and don’t miss seafood stews or guided wine tastings.</p>
